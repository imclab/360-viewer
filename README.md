## Done

### Milestone 0 - September 2013

- Version up and running
- Browser-support: IE8+, iOS 5+ Android 4+
- Rotate on drag
- Handle touch and mouse
- Zoom-lens effect(on desktop+mobile)
- Zoom on click (on desktop) and on hold (on mobile)
- Cursor icon
- Image caching / preloader
- Animate on load

### Milestone 1 - October 2013
- avoid moving zoom-lens beyond image / constraint on edge
- allow interaction during rotate

- logo on top with fade-out 
## TODO

### Initial version

- connect with API (implemented with local version, waiting for proper jsonp on backend)
- gif progress indicator
- zoom button
- fullscreen button
- labels/markers/interaction points
- customer logo
- fullscreen(on both desktop and mobile)
- multitouch - see if we can enable zoom/scroll by no-preventDefault when multifinger
- IE - test

### Future

- test/make sure it works also wit small data sets of 1. picture
- icons / documentation - zoom-lense(desktop), fullscreen, close(fullscreen)
- animate during load, instead of animate on load
- thumbnails when few pictures (maybe instead of drag)
- smoother animate on load

## Why img.src replacement

When targeting mobile devices,
and possibly several 360ยบ views on a page,
memory is more likely to be bottleneck than CPU.

We therefore just preload the compressed images
into the browsers component cache, 
and decompress them at render time.

The actual rendering is then just replacing
the `src` of an image tag, - also making it work
in non-HTML5 browsers, such as IE8, 
which we also need to support.
